# 1. Set-up

## 1.1 Is Git Installed?

1)  Open RStudio

2)  Click on the Terminal tab

3)  Type *which git*

If Git is already installed you will get a directory outputted

If Git is not installed (and you are a Mac user) type "git config" into terminal and follow prompts

## 1.2 Configuration (within R)

Computer scientists (and so most internet tutorials) do configuration of Git in the console.

But you can do it in R!

```{r}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Angus",
               user.email = "angus@greavesfamily.org")
```

If you already have a git/github account make sure you use the same login details

# 2. Git & R Studio Basics

## 2.1.1 Enabling Git on a Project

Warning: will restart RStudio

Tools \> Project Options \> Git/SVN Select Git as your "version control system"

## 2.2.1 Your First Commit

1)  One of the panes in R studio will have a git header (I have no idea which one as I moved mine from default); click on the git header.

2)  Click on the white boxes next to the items you wish to commit to your repository and have changes tracked

3)  Press commit 

See screenshot on next slide

## 2.2.2 Your First Commit
![](2_screenshot_git.png)

## 2.2.3 Your First Commit

You should now be in the staging area

4)  Write a commit message (brief message, in present tense)

5)  Press commit

See screnshot on next slide

## 2.2.4 Your First Commit
![](3_screenshot_commit)

## 2.2.5 Your First Commit

6)  Click on the changes tab in the top left to see a list of your commits and the changes

![](4_screenshot_changes)

## 2.2.6 Your First Commit

Don't commit too regularly or this changes tab will loses all value.

Don't commit to infrequently or using git loses value

## 2.3.1 Reverting to a previous commit

**THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE**

1)  Go to the terminal tab in the relevant RStudio pane

2a) Type *"git reset --hard HEAD\^"*

This takes you back one commit.

Where possible just use the *undo* button

# 3. Branches

Not sure if you will want to keep your changes? Make a branch!

## 3.1.1 Your First Branch

1)  Press on the git header
2)  Click the purple branch button (1) and name your new branch

![](5_screenshot_branch)

## 3.1.2 Your First Branch

3)  Now, you can edit the content without altering the orginial branch

4)  Make some changes to the files in this branch

5)  Commit these changes

## 3.1.3 Your First Branch

6)  Click on the downward arrow/name of branch (2) to move between branches- switch to the main branch

7)  Create a new file and insert anything

8)  Commit these changes

![](5_screenshot_branch)

## 3.1.4 Your First Branch

In the commit window you can switch between branches in the top left, and see changes that have been made

![](6_screenshot_branchcommit)

# 4. Merging Branches

Next we will see how to merge an edited branch with the original branch

CAUTION: avoid editing the same file in two different branches or you will get a conflict

## 4.1.1 Merging without Conflicts

1)  When merging you want to start in the branch you are merging into

2)  Go to the terminal tab within RStudio

3)  Type *git merge branch_name --message "your message"*

    1)  Message is not strictly needed but avoids RStudio being an arsehole

    2)  Replace "your message" with your message

## 4.1.2 Merging without Conflicts 
If you go to the commit tab you can see your merge!
![](7_screenshot_merge)


## 4.1.3 Merging without Conflicts
4) It is common practice to now delete the unneeded branch by going to the terminal and type *git branch -d branch_name*

## 4.2.1 Merging with Conflicts
First: If you start a commit, get a conflict message, panic, and want to stop the commit type *git merge --abort* into the terminal pane withon RStudio.

If cooler heads have prevailed- keep reading

## 4.2.2 Merging with Conflicts

My colour favourite is blue
