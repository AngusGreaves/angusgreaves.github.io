# 1. Set-up

## 1.1 Is Git Installed?

1)  Open RStudio

2)  Click on the "Terminal"

3)  Type "which git"

If Git is already installed you will get a directory outputted

If Git is not installed (and you are a Mac user) type "git config" into terminal and follow prompts

## 1.2 Configuration (within R)

Computer scientists (and so most internet tutorials) do configuration of Git in the console.

But you can do it in R!

```{r}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name",
               user.email = "your@email.com")
```

If you already have a git/github account make sure you use the same login details

# 2. Git & R Studio Basics

## 2.2 Your First Commit

1)  One of the panes in R studio will have a git header (I have no idea which one as I moved mine from default); click on the git header.

2)  Click on the white boxes next to the items you wish to commit to your repository and have changes tracked

3) Press commit
